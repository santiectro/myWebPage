                So? Who am I? Well, let me introduce me. My name is David, currently 21 years old insterested in web-development and programming
                I have been coding for a year now but just recently started getting my feet wet on web-development, if you would
                like to see my projects or skills I would highly recommend you to check those two links at the top of the page.
                I am currently eager to learn all of the new skills that this world holds.

                Since I started in Codecademy I have learn a lot of new things and created different small projects one 
                of those was the "Smart Wallet" which was just a website for a fake company that was associated to blockchain
                I did it with the help of grids, flexboxes and more features, in case that you would like to take a look click on
                the picture

                There were a lot of different projects on the CS50 course, all of them were amazing and they teach me something
                new everytime, nonetheless the one that I liked the most was one where we were required to created some sort of
                website that let an user buy and sell shares, it had, SQL, JavaScript, an API, HTML and CSSS
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
                As the last project of the CS50 course we were told to built something pretty much anything, I decided
                to create some sort of Mario game that had enemies, ducks stones that you could move and 3 levels that you
                needed to pass this project was created on Love2d and the Lua programming languaje

            <p class="project-text">
                I have also created a vary basic program on Arduino that let the user control some servo motors attach to each
                other on a form of an arm with a joystick so they could pick up something, this was made on College and It programming 
                wise it was only arduino but I used some other componets like the joystick ther servo motors and some sensors.

                        When it comes to Python I do believe that I have a begginner-intermediate knowledge
                        I have written different programs on python and it was also the very first language
                        I learned, the different websites built in the CS50 course where python related.

                         I guess that HTML and CSS you can judge them by yourself looking at the website, although
                         I do believe there is a lot of learning coming I would say I have a decent knowledge on
                         both tools.

                         Thanks to CS50 we were also introduce to the SQL database to solve a mystery which was amazing
                         and fun to go trough I also gained some intermidate knowledge on the topic.

                        My javaScript I would say is a solid 7, I have been practicing it for a while now to 
                        handle the logic from different websites and creating little programs for myself there's still room to 
                        grow but I feel confident about it.
